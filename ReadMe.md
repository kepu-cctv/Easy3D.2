### Easy3D provides: ###
* Efficient data structures for representing and managing3D models (i.e., point clouds and meshes).
* High-level encapsulation of OpenGL and GLSL for convenient and efficient rendering. Any types of 
  3D drawables (e.g., point clouds, mesh surfaces, scalar fields, vector fields) can be rendered 
  by writing a few lines of code. Users do not need to touch the low-level OpenGL APIs.
* A viewer that can be used directly to visualized 3D scenes in various formats. 

Easy3D is intended for research and educational purposes. It can also be used as a starting point 
for developing more sophisticated 3D applications.
