     * \brief Implementation of a simple signal-slot mechanism. \par
     * \details Multiple slots (classes and their member functions) can be connected to a signal object.
     *        You can connect functions to the signal which will be called when the trigger() method on the signal
     *        object is invoked. Any argument passed to emit() will be passed to the given functions. A typical usage
     *        of Signal in Easy3D is camera manipulation. When the camera has been manipulated, the viewer should be
     *        notified (e.g., a repaint event should be triggered). This is done by calling to the viewer's update()
     *        function. So in Easy3D, the viewer's update function is connected to the camera.
     * \note Current implementation can hold only one single function of each owner.
     * \class Signal easy3d/core/signal.h
     * \todo Extend this class to accept multiple functions of a class.
