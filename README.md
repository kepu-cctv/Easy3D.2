# Easy3D
An easy, lightweight, and flexible framework for developing cross-platform 3D applications.

Easy3D provides:
* Efficient data structures for representing 3D data (i.e., point clouds and meshes).
* High-level encapsulation of OpenGL and GLSL for efficient rendering a set of points, lines, 
  and/or polygons (and thus point clouds, mesh surfaces, scalar fields, vector fields) be 
  easily rendered by writing a few lines of code. 
* A viewer that can be used directly to visualized 3D scenes in various formats. It
  can also be used as starting point for developing more sophisticated 3D viewers.
