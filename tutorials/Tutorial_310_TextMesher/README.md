TextMesher was creatd to produce the Easy3D logo. I made it a separate program in the hope that it is helpful.

TextMesher is based on
 - [the FreeType library](https://www.freetype.org/): for decoding fonts and converting texts into a vector representation);
 - [Easy3D](https://github.com/LiangliangNan/Easy3D): for triangulating the character contours, extruding, storing, and 
   visualizing the mesh models.

Build TextMesher
 - download FreeType (either the prebuilt binaries or building it from its source code);
 - download the entire Easy3D source code and use the CMakeList.txt in the root directory. 

Enjoy!
