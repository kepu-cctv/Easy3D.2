# It defines the following variables:
#       EASY3D_INCLUDE_DIRS - include directories for EASY3D
#       EASY3D_LIBRARIES    - available Easy3D libraries
# NOTE: The recommended way to specify libraries and headers with CMake is to use the
#       target_link_libraries command. This command automatically adds appropriate include
#       directories, compile definitions, the position-independent-code flag, and links to
#       requested libraries.
